## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

# Initial Setup

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/jonathan-rose/deathclocks.git`

From within the deathclocks directory, install the dependencies:

`npm install`

To run:

``npm start``

This will start a local live server and open a browser window to localhost:8080 with the game running.
